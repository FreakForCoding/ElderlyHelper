        <p class="h4" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Bird Dog</strong></p>
        <p style=" width: 900px; margin-left: 320px;">Good for abdominals and back support. The health of the spine is
          extremely important as we age. Start by kneeling and stretching one arm forward and the opposite leg back.
          Imagine you have a tea cup on your back and draw your belly button towards your spine. Stay for a breath and
          then switch sides. Repeat five times.</p>

        <p style=" width: 900px; margin-left: 320px;">This position is great for joint health, flexibility and all-over
          body strength. Start on your hands and knees, tuck your toes under and lift your hips up and back until your
          body forms a triangle. Use your core strength and legs to bring the weight back as much as possible. Stay for
          five to eight breaths, lower yourself down, and repeat two more times. For seniors with wrist issues, try the
          Forearm Downward Dog instead, putting your forearms flat on the mat.</p>

          syndrome. Sphinx is gentle and really does a great job of opening up the chest and working the rear deltoids.

          your arms and draw your shoulder blades together and down your back. Lift your abdominals in and up and stay
          for five to eight breaths.</p>

          massage their feet. Sit tall and bring the soles of the feet together as you open your knees out to the sides.
          Fold yourself forward for a deeper stretch but try to prevent rounding too much in the lower back. Hold for
          five to eight breaths.</p>
      </div>

        <p class="h4" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Savasana</strong></p>

          to the body and mind. Lie on your back in final relaxation. It’s good for seniors to get comfortable with
          letting go more often throughout the day. Lie down and let the floor support you. Completely relax the muscles
          and breathe as you lie there and take a deep, restorative break.</p>

<h2 id="Experienced"><strong>Experienced Yoga poses</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>1. Chaturanga Dandasana – Plank Pose</strong></h3>
<p>Chaturanga dandasana is the best way to strengthen your core. As simple as it looks, its benefits are immense.</p>
<p>It is only when you are in the pose that you start to feel its intensity on your abdominal muscles.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Virabhadrasana – Warrior Pose</strong></h3>
<p>Toning your thighs and shoulders, as well as improving your concentration has become more accessible and interesting
  with the Warrior II pose. The more you hold that pose, the better the results you gain. With just a few minutes of
  Virabhadrasana, you will get tighter quads.</p>

</div>
<p>Warrior III pose is made to improve your balance along with toning your back end, legs, and arms. It also helps to
  tone your tummy and give you a flat belly if you contract your abdominal muscles while you hold the position.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Trikonasana – Triangle pose</strong></h3>
<p>The trikonasana helps to improve digestion as well as reduce the fat deposited in the belly &amp; waist. It
  stimulates and improves blood circulation in the entire body. The lateral motion of this asana helps you burn more fat
  from the waist and build more muscles in the thighs and hamstrings.</p>
<p>Though this pose does not make your muscles shake as others do, it does give you the benefit that other asanas do. It
  also improves balance &amp; concentration.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Adho Mukha Svanasana – Downward Dog pose</strong></h3>
<p>Adho Mukha Svanasana tones your whole body with a little extra attention to specific muscles.</p>
<p>It helps to strengthen your arms, thighs, hamstring and back. Holding this pose and concentrating on your breathing
  engages your muscles and tones them, as well as improves your concentration and blood circulation.</p>

  your back muscles and reduces back pain.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Parivrtta Utkatasana – Twisted Chair pose</strong></h3>
<p>The Parivrtta Utkatasana is also called the Yoga’s version of the squat. But you must know that it is a little more
  intense and tones the abdominal muscles, works the quads and glutes.</p>

  <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: 100; width: 1000px; font-style: italic; margin-left: 270px; justify-content: center; "> Benefits of Yoga for Seniors

    Retirement is the perfect time to try some new things and pick up some healthier habits you may not have had time to consider in your working years. If you’ve never tried yoga before, check out a class and experience some of the benefits of yoga for seniors like:
    
        Strengthened bones. Yoga for seniors can help prevent the onset of osteoporosis, which causes bones to become brittle or weak. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone can’t keep up with the decrease of bone mass and density that occurs with aging.
        Reduced stress. Yoga offers a relaxing way to let go of the tension you’re holding in your body, especially in your shoulders and upper back. It’s been known to help relieve some of the stresses that lead to hypertension, which in turn leads to not needing as many medications on a daily basis. Yoga also helps reduce anxiety, lowering your heart rate, blood pressure, and helping you breathe easier.
        Improved sleeping habits. Because yoga for seniors can be so relaxing, many individuals report that they are sleeping longer and more soundly, which can often be an issue for older adults.
        Enhanced balance, flexibility, mobility and strength. The slow, measured movements involved with yoga poses can lead to better balance and movement, which can also help prevent falls. As falls are the leading cause of injury among seniors, yoga helps provide the tools you need to improve your mobility so you can get around more safely.
        Lessen the risk for depression. Yoga is a mood-booster; the combination of movement, breathing and meditation can create an overall sense of well-being. Plus, because yoga is done in a class setting with your peers, you’re getting the benefit of staying socially active, as well.
        Alleviate aches and pains. Even if you have some physical limitations, yoga can help ease the aches and pains associated with aging. Yoga can be especially beneficial to those suffering from osteoarthritis, teaching you how to breathe and relax through any chronic pain you may be dealing with.
    
    If you’re interested in trying out a yoga class, make sure you do a little research before you jump right into it. Many senior centers offer yoga especially for older adults, and these instructors will be well-versed in the techniques most beneficial to seniors.
    
    Try a gentle class for beginners and if any of the poses are uncomfortable or lead to pain, know your limits. No matter what your current fitness level is, seniors can benefit from yoga every bit as much as younger adults.

      <span id="pk-id" value="40161450"><p>Maintaining bone and muscle strength, balance and&nbsp;cardiorespiratory&nbsp;health can become more of a challenge. As a result, some seniors have a hard time staying as physically fit as they once were.<br><br>This can lead to a difficult cycle, however, as the less activity you get, the weaker those systems can become, which further limits mobility. The way you stay active as you age may change over time, but that doesn't mean it has to stop entirely. In fact, many inspiring seniors are able to make stunning athletic achievements at every age:</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Johanna Quaas, 91-year old gymnast</strong><br>Johanna Quaas wowed the audience at the June 2017 International German Gymnastics Festival with an impressive parallel bar routine that would be inspiring at any age - but at 91-years-old, Johanna's athletic skills are particularly impactful. According to the Washington Post, Johanna currently holds the Guinness World Record for being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/06/20/my-face-is-old-but-my-heart-is-young-worlds-oldest-gymnast-still-has-moves-at-91/?utm_term=.bacb155d63fd" target="_blank">the oldest gymnast</a>, a title she's held since 2012.<br><br>She began the sport in 1934 - when she was just 9 years old. After having her family, she took some time off to focus on coaching, but began competing again for herself when she was 56.&nbsp;<br><br>On top of that? She's also a championship&nbsp;handball player as well!<br><br>"I do gymnastics to avoid being susceptible to falls and that is a good preventive tool," she said.<br><br>When she was first named the world's oldest gymnast, her goal was to still be participating in the sport when she was 90. That milestone has come and gone, and Johanna has no intention of stopping any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe class="youtube-player" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOQGI4qIKgI?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" type="text/html" width="770"></iframe></p><p><strong>2. Ed Whitlock, 85-year-old runner</strong><br>Ed Whitlock made a name for himself in the world of marathon running with a number of impressive titles and records, including being the first person over the age of 70 to complete a full marathon in less than three hours. The New York Times reported that his most recent record was set in October 2016 at the the Toronto Waterfront Marathon&nbsp;- Ed became the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/sports/ed-whitlock-marathon-running.html" target="_blank">oldest person to finish</a> a marathon in less than four hours.&nbsp;<br><br>Running a marathon is grueling work - to maintain speed for 26.2 miles takes incredible strength and endurance. It often requires a lot of training and supplemental exercises. Yet Ed didn't need any special guidance or resources for his achievements. He simply ran laps for a few hours every day. When he set his record at the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, he was wearing shoes that were 15 years old.&nbsp;<br><br>"I believe people can do far more than they think they can," Ed told The New York Times.&nbsp;<br><br>Scientists studied Ed's physiology in 2012 and found that his muscles had an incredible capacity for taking in oxygen, which can greatly improve endurance. Many athletes, like runners and swimmers, focus on training that can help them increase their own intakes, known as&nbsp;VO2 max. Ed's consistent running schedule made it easier for his body to process oxygen, which made it easier for him to run, creating a fitness cycle that helped him to excel in his sport.&nbsp;<br><br>Just months after completing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, Ed passed away from prostate cancer in March 2017. He was an incredible example of what people can achieve at any age so long as they are willing to put the time and energy into it.&nbsp;</p><div style="width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><style type="text/css">iframe.twitter-tweet.twitter-tweet-rendered{ width: 99%!important;}</style><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><iframe id="twitter-widget-0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="" style="position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 393px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;" title="Twitter Tweet" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfdGltZWxpbmVfbGlzdCI6eyJidWNrZXQiOlsibGlua3RyLmVlIiwidHIuZWUiLCJ0ZXJyYS5jb20uYnIiLCJ3d3cubGlua3RyLmVlIiwid3d3LnRyLmVlIiwid3d3LnRlcnJhLmNvbS5iciJdLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdGltZWxpbmVfMTIwMzQiOnsiYnVja2V0IjoidHJlYXRtZW50IiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd190d2VldF9lZGl0X2JhY2tlbmQiOnsiYnVja2V0Ijoib24iLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3JlZnNyY19zZXNzaW9uIjp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6Im9uIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd19jaGluX3BpbGxzXzE0NzQxIjp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6ImNvbG9yX2ljb25zIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd190d2VldF9yZXN1bHRfbWlncmF0aW9uXzEzOTc5Ijp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6InR3ZWV0X3Jlc3VsdCIsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ0Zndfc2Vuc2l0aXZlX21lZGlhX2ludGVyc3RpdGlhbF8xMzk2MyI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJpbnRlcnN0aXRpYWwiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2V4cGVyaW1lbnRzX2Nvb2tpZV9leHBpcmF0aW9uIjp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6MTIwOTYwMCwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd19kdXBsaWNhdGVfc2NyaWJlc190b19zZXR0aW5ncyI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJvbiIsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ0ZndfdmlkZW9faGxzX2R5bmFtaWNfbWFuaWZlc3RzXzE1MDgyIjp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6InRydWVfYml0cmF0ZSIsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ0ZndfdHdlZXRfZWRpdF9mcm9udGVuZCI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJvbiIsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9fQ%3D%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=824539982916448257&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunriseseniorliving.com%2Fblog%2Fjuly-2017%2F5-seniors-with-inspirational-fitness-stories.aspx&amp;sessionId=40c53f29128d5fa54d254d777814911e4bb13dbd&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=1c23387b1f70c%3A1664388199485&amp;width=550px" data-tweet-id="824539982916448257"></iframe></div><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Charles Eugster, 97-year-old rower and body builder</strong><br>During his university years, Charles Eugster&nbsp;was on a competitive rowing team and then joined the Swiss Army.

Don Pellman, 101-year-old Olympian</strong><br>In the 2015&nbsp;San Diego Senior Olympics, Don Pellman&nbsp;set five new world records - at age 100. The New York Times reported that he was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/sports/a-bolt-from-the-past-don-pellmann-at-100-is-still-breaking-records.html" target="_blank">oldest person competing</a> in the games when he became the first centenarian to complete the 100-meter dash in under 27 seconds, and the first to clear the bar at an official&nbsp;height for the high jump.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to his achievements as the first centenarian, he also set new records in shot-put, long jump and discus for his age bracket.</p><p>As a youth athlete, Don was a gymnast and high jumper. The Times reported that he left his college track career to get a job during the Great Depression. It wasn't until after he retired in 1970 that he, with the urging of his children, decided to once again pick up the sport he still missed. He's completed 127 meets since then. He's now 101 years old.&nbsp;<br><br>Don clearly loves to push himself and aim high - despite his impressive feats, he said he was disappointed he didn't perform even better on the high jump. Nonetheless, he's still tied with&nbsp;Jesse Owens's record for setting the most world records in one day.</p><p><strong>Staying in shape as you age</strong><br>While not everyone needs to be setting records in their chosen sport in their 80s, 90s or 100s, staying in shape is still important for seniors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults get at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm" target="_blank">150 minutes a week</a> of moderate exercise. In addition, they should do two days a week of strength training. This can be as simple as taking a brisk walk and performing some low-impact body weight exercises at home. Gym memberships, group fitness classes or joining a sports group are good ways to also stay active for those who enjoy such hobbies.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've been inactive for awhile, it's not too late to get into better shape at any age! Talk to your doctor about finding a safe fitness plan that works for you - you can start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and amount of time you put into activities until you reach your personal fitness goals.&nbsp;</p>
