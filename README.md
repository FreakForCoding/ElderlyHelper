# ElderlyHelper

I've created a dynamic website using MongoDb, Node js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript which helps elders to stay fit with customized articles and Diet.

A dynamic website which Helps Elders to Stay fit and up for any daily challenge they used to struggle with.

please download from the master branch my code is there...

Firstly download the files see if the location of every file is responding correctly or not, If it is working correctly go ahead and Run the Index.js file if it Runs properly it will display: Listening on port 3000 Connected to Database

Next open your browser and enter this Address: http://localhost:3000/ElderlyHelper.html

After that if everything's location is properly defined Every Image should load and every function should run properly: {may not run cause I'm still a Noob on github but, I'm sure it will run properly if everythng's connected properly} What will happen After this You can refer Project ElderlyHelper.doc for that which is in this folder only: I'll attach a drive Link here soon So that every folder can be accessed just the way it was:

You may have to run: npm init npm install mongoose etc commands first to run it properly: So take Caution: Hope this works : If it doesn't ping me on whatsapp: 8668428101
